# Speaker Recognition From Scratch

## Overview

This is the reference code of the project for the [Speaker Recognition course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/speaker-recognition/?referralCode=1914766AF241CE15D19A).

In this project, we will build an LSTM-based speaker recognition system from scratch.

We will train the neural network on LibriSpeech, and evaluate it.

The purpose of this project is to build a **minimal working system** using simple Python code, for the purpose of learning the basic concepts. Many details have been largely simplified to make the code easier to understand.

Please keep in mind:

* We are NOT trying to build a state-of-the-art.
* We are NOT trying to use best software engineering practice.
* We will NOT make use of many advanced library or features.
